# slash tcp


### A python script which is designed to automatically detect and terminate unwanted, resource-consuming zombie TCP sessions on networks. 

### This presentation covers the risks posed by zombie sessions, project objectives, technical background, design architecture, key features, implementation *** details, termination mechanisms, testing results, deployment considerations, and a roadmap for future enhancements. 

### Our script aims to provide a proactive solution to ensure network security and efficiency by eliminating the presence of zombie sessions.

# How to run:

* run cmd : ```source/py_run.sh```
*  and to finally run it : ```zombie_kill```

# There is another script in the dev branch which can save all the tcp packets going back and forth from the ports into respective files if you want to analyse the ports
