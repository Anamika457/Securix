# slash tcp


### A python script which is designed to automatically detect and terminate unwanted, resource-consuming zombie TCP sessions on networks. 

### Our script aims to provide a proactive solution to ensure network security and efficiency by eliminating the presence of zombie sessions.

# How to run:

* run cmd : ```source/py_run.sh```
*  and to finally run it : ```zombie_kill```

#### This script does not list the sessions that are in ESTABLISHED STATE to analyse those use the ```zombie_v2.py``` in ```analyse_established branch``` 
##### There is another script in the dev branch which can save all the tcp packets going back and forth from the ports into respective files if you want to analyse the ports
